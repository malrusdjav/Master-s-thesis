Objective: to plot energy versus distance in a diatomic HF molecule for different exchange correlation functionals 
(XC) in different basis sets

The XCs taken as:
['b3lyp', 'pbe0']

For each of them the energy versus distance plot was plotted for the following basis sets:
['sto-2g', 'sto-3g', 'sto-6g']

The graphs for each XC were plotted on a separate figure using the matplotlib library
